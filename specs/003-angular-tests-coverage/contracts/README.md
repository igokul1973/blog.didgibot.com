# Contracts: Angular Test Coverage

This feature does not introduce external HTTP APIs. Contracts for this feature are **internal conventions** around:

- Coverage configuration for Vitest (which files are included/excluded)
- Structure of coverage reports consumed by tooling or documentation

If, in future, coverage data is exposed via an API or dashboard service, describe the request/response contracts here and provide OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas as needed.
