## Specification
I currently have 2 files: `cicd/Dockerfile.production` and `cicd/Jenkinsfile_test`. Those files are written for the CICD process for my Python web backend. 
I'd like to create the same but for the current project, i.e. Angular FE.
I want to be able to push changes to the main branch (via push or PR merge), and the CICD system on Jenkins will use container created from image 
made with Dockerfile.production to run pipeline stages corresponding to stages in Dockerfile.production.
The stages should be the same as in the current `cicd/Jenkinsfile_test`, with the addition of `testing` stage in parallel with the linting stage (if
you think it is possible and reasonable, else recommend a different stages order).

All commands running in the `cicd/Dockerfile.production` must be using scripts section commands from package.json.
Mind you, the package manager used is `pnpm`.
Specifically, for `testing` stage I'd like to have `pnpm test:coverage` command used. This command, among other existing ones, must create as final 
pipeline artifact the coverage html file (or any other visual format) that could be checked in Jenkins UI. The pipeline should fail if less than 90% 
of test coverage has been detected on any tested file (component/pipe/service, etc.) unless it is in the exceptions (please define where the coverage 
exceptions are in the current codebase - in vite.config.ts?).
Testing of the new pipeline can be done on current Jenkins server by pushing changes to the remote branch as soon as you come up with the name. I,
as a human, will modify the current pipeline to get triggered for the branch.

In other words, this task is to modify the `cicd/Jenkinsfile_test` and `cicd/Dockerfile.production` in order to do the same thing they are doing now
but for the current project for node JS. 

Take the Node.js version from the current `cicd/Dockerfile.node`. As soon as the `cicd/Jenkinsfile_test` is ready and 
approved, rename the current `cicd/Jenkinsfile` (which you should also consult for the currently running pipeline for comparison and analysis) to 
`cicd/Jenkinsfile_deprecated` with corresponding comments on it, and rename the `cicd/Jenkinsfile_test` to `cicd/Jenkinsfile`.
For additional information consult also the pod manifest `cicd/node-git-chromium-pod.yaml`, which is used to run in the Jenkins pipeline in Kubernetes pod now.
The `image: igk19/node-git-chromium:1.0.10` in that file is the image created from the current `cicd/Dockerfile.node`. You should also consult the 
`cicd/Dockerfile.node` for comparison and analysis.
This task should also create a new image for the `cicd/node-git-chromium-pod.yaml` to run, so modify `cicd/node-git-chromium-pod.yaml` after that image
creation. The image, of course, must be created and pushed to my Docker registry from the new and approved `cicd/Dockerfile.production`. Call the 
image: `igk19/node-22:1.0.0`.

Ask me questions if anything is not clear.
